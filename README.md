### How is my score calculated?

```
Having an Account: 5 points
Public Repo: 10 points per
Public Gists: 1 point per
Followers: 0.10 points per
Most Started Public Repo: 1 point per star
```

### Is this algorithim final?

Of course not. I would like the open source community to determine what a "score" means. I just started the discussion.

### How did you come up with this idea?

I was inspired by the popular World of Warcraft addon [PlayerScore](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12245-PlayerScoreGearScore.html).

### This is dumb / You are ruining everything / WTF?!?

Let me be clear: I was no fan of PlayerScore / GearScore back in the day as it equated the skills of players in WoW to a single number. However,
it did make Blizzard think more about the role of quality players in their game and has contributed to some positive changes in the game. Some people might say it ruined the game, though. Either way, it got the conversation started.

My intent with this extension isn't to cause a rift in the community or narrow down everyone's contributions to a single number. The goal is to make people aware of how a person contributes to open source software and help people findquality contributors to open source.

And, as mentioned above, the algorithm is not set in stone and is ultimately up to the community to determine.
